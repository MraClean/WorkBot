## About:

> Read the backstory idiot

## Backstory:
> Lets say your drunk one night and decide to do stupid things, thats what this is about,
>
> I, have made a bot that has some features
>
> create team,
> 
> teams
>
> view as team
>
> add member
>
> So this is basically a team bot
>
> You can add people to each team and give them tasks
>
> The person who got the task can add work to it (aka a url)
>
> Then only viewing as a team can let you see the work
>
> Basically heres how it works
>
> So if your, Bob and you have a development team you want to create a team
>
> Using create team bob does that and adds the members with add member
>
> Then the people in the team can pass assignments to each other for things they need
>
> The person gets the dm and does the work. They turn the work in so the rest of the team can use it
>
> This allows assets to be shared faster
>
> Why not use Trello
>
> Since Im stupid and didn't think that Trello existed
