# Work Bot

## Dbl Description:

> So you can start a team with `wb!team`. 
>
> With this team you can now add members with `wb!addmember`.
>
>Now with a member in the team you can assign a task to somebody with `wb!assgin`.
>
>Then you put in their discord id, name of the task, description of the task, and the due date of the task.
>
>Once they completed the task they can use `wb!turnIn`. 
>
>They put in the Url of the assignment since files are not supported yet.
>
>The person who was assigned the assignment can no longer edit it after its turned in.
>
>The only people who can view it is the team as a whole.
>
>For somebody to view an assignment before they turn it in they use `wb!view [id]`.
>
>The id is gotten from using `wb!tasks`, the id is the text after the name.
>
>For the team to view all tasks, turned in or not they use `wb!viewAllWork` for all assignments.
>
>To view a specific assignment they use `wb!viewAsTeam [id]`.
>
>Since of the way data is stored, only people in the team can view assignments.
>
>This allows security and prevents people from taking the links.
>
>The mentioned part is only the main part of the bot. There is moderation as well. 
>
>Use `wb!help all` for all the commands.
